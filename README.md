# ML-Regression-LR-SVM-RF-
This project is about testing different regression models using the Insurance dataset
## Data Analysis
started by doing data analysis on the Insurance Dataset, and performing EDA on the variables.
## Data Preprocessing
went on to do label encoding and visualize the variables as well as doing correlation tests on the variables.
## Feature Engineering and Model Building
performed feature engineering on the data. From there went on to train three models
1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Model
3. Random Forest Regressor
All these were using the sklearn library.
From the final results, the Random Forest regressor was the best-performing model.
